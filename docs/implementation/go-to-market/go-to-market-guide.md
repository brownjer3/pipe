## Conclusion

Pipe V0 focuses on solving one problem exceptionally well: eliminating context loss between GitHub and Slack. By launching with a minimal but highly useful feature set, we can validate the market need, gather feedback, and build momentum for expansion.

The key to success is maintaining laser focus on the developer experience:
1. 5-minute setup (actually achievable)
2. Immediate value (first search shows the magic)
3. Reliable performance (better to do less, but do it well)
4. Responsive support (build trust with early users)

With this approach, Pipe can grow from 0 to 500 users in 8 weeks and establish product-market fit for the larger vision of eliminating the $50K/year context switching cost.

**Next Step:** Start with Week 1 infrastructure setup and begin building the core MCP protocol handler.
